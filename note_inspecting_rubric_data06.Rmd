# Objective
Data are mostly cleaned and organized; PLOs are largely matched for Standard 4 reporting; yet, there are several critically missing pieces. 1) Present the outcomes for those which are present and 2) sort out the current situation and follow up with faculty/staff for missing information (i.e. missing data, assessments, and mappings).

# Set up
Import data. Codes are externalized for reuse. As a reference:

- `mdf` or main data frame contains the rubric outcome data merged with the course/assessment information gathered from the survey. Data are cleaned up.
- `non` or non-rubric data frame is separated from the same data source as the rubric information of `mdf`. It contains the instructor's assessments of outcomes at course level. Data are cleaned up.
- `past` data frame contains the assessment outcome data from the past.
- `rowmap` data frame summarizes the mapping between PLOs and rubric rows.
```{r}
source('read.R')
source('munge.R')
```

Those scripts have been updated to use the *edited* version of the survey result data. See Note 5 for details.

Given that change, the Notebooks 1-5 are completely outdated.

# PLO Measures for Standard 4

## Overview
For Standard 4, we only need a rather small subset of the assessments available. Produce the summary of outcomes in the context of historical changes. 

- ACBSP requires 3-5 data points, so make sure to have sufficient numbers.
- ACBSP requires graphs with sample sizes.
- Nuventive requires numbers. Produce data tables along with the graphs.

Once Standard 4 is done, we can discuss weakness/shortcomings and strength/improvements in our program, then look at other courses - including the ones at an earlier stage of each program - to find *opportunities for improvement* and *close the loop*. That is, we can get to **Standard 6** analysis.

## Summarize Outcomes
Rubric outcome data are collected at individual level. Take average over `Course` level for each assignment. All the inconsistencies have been dealt with.
```{r}
# Undergrad focus for now
tbl1 <- mdf %>% filter(str_detect(Name, "Major|Minor", negate = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(Course, Assessment, Name, PLO) %>%
  summarise(Met = mean(Met.UND.bin), Met.GRD = mean(Met.GRD.bin), n = n())
```

Non-rubric data are collected at `Section` level and as shares of students who achieved goals. Use the class size as a weight to have the proper aggregation. Moreover, keep the `PLO` column for identifying apparently-identical assessments (e.g. different parts of exams).
```{r}
tbl2 <- non %>%
  group_by(Course, Assessment, PLO) %>%
  summarise(Met = weighted.mean(x = np/n, w = n, na.rm = TRUE),
            Met.GRD = Met,
            n = sum(n, na.rm = TRUE), Name = "NA")
```

Now the outcomes are summarized in a compatible way for both rubric-based and non rubric-based assessments.
```{r}
tbl3 <- tbl1 %>% bind_rows(tbl2)
```

## Prepare
```{r}
get_outcome <- function(plotag, rrow, program, plo, grad = FALSE){
  if(is.na(plotag)){return(NA)}
  if(grad){
    tbl3 %>% filter(PLO == plotag, str_detect(Name, rrow)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
      summarize(Met = mean(Met.GRD), n = min(n)) %>%
      mutate(Program = program, PLO = plo)
  }
  else{
    tbl3 %>% filter(PLO == plotag, str_detect(Name, rrow)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
      summarize(Met = mean(Met), n = min(n)) %>%
      mutate(Program = program, PLO = plo)
  }

## Follow Up

```{r}
survey %>% filter(`Follow up` != "NA")
```

- [ ] Fatma El-Hamidi, Spring 2020, BUS 381-002, Final Exam, No assessment for an exam?
- [x] Beth, Fall 2019, BUS 499-GW1, Simulation After Action Report, Mapped to anything? > **Same as GoVenture AAR** ...Fixed.
- [x] Dave & Paul R. Ask Beth? BUS 799, "Chapter Case Study" "Comprehensive Project". Supposed to be exam scores? >> Waiting for Stephanie.
- [x] Chris? FIN 301. "Ratio Calculation", "Ratio Interpretation Signature Assignment #3", "NPV Calculation", "Moral Hazard" (Ed inputs); FIN 301 "Ration Analysis - Rich Uncle Scenario" (Chris entered); "Signature Assignment 3", "Signature Assignment 2" (Nan entered). >> Nan's response clarified most. Helpful to know that the Signature Assignment 3 (Capital Budgeting) was discontinued. No wonder I can't have a consistent matching.
- [x] To begin with, Finance program should use FIN 302 Capital Budgeting for assessment of both 1 and 2. Likely outdated? Ask Nan. >> Okay, **FIN 301 is not used for proram assessment.** I need FIN 302 data for assessment. Remove all FIN 301 plo tags. ...Done.
- [ ] Rich MKT 300. Assess PLO 1-10â€¦ while only 1-3 available?
FIN 711 for MBA 3, missing. ...Wait. It should be from 401. Eric Freeman taught and answered. >>

I'm so confused. I suppose those files in 2019-20 folder are updated versions. However, worksheets contradict with the overview sheet. I don't know what data those sheets refer to.
