# Objective
Data are mostly cleaned and organized; PLOs are largely matched for Standard 4 reporting; yet, there are several critically missing pieces. 1) Present the outcomes for those which are present and 2) sort out the current situation and follow up with faculty/staff for missing information (i.e. missing data, assessments, and mappings).

# Set up
Import data. Codes are externalized for reuse. As a reference:

- `mdf` or main data frame contains the rubric outcome data merged with the course/assessment information gathered from the survey. Data are cleaned up.
- `non` or non-rubric data frame is separated from the same data source as the rubric information of `mdf`. It contains the instructor's assessments of outcomes at course level. Data are cleaned up.
- `past` data frame contains the assessment outcome data from the past.
- `rowmap` data frame summarizes the mapping between PLOs and rubric rows.
```{r}
source('read.R')
source('munge.R')
```

Those scripts have been updated to use the *edited* version of the survey result data. See Note 5 for details.

Given that change, the Notebooks 1-5 are completely outdated.

# PLO Measures for Standard 4

## Overview
For Standard 4, we only need a rather small subset of the assessments available. Produce the summary of outcomes in the context of historical changes. 

- ACBSP requires 3-5 data points, so make sure to have sufficient numbers.
- ACBSP requires graphs with sample sizes.
- Nuventive requires numbers. Produce data tables along with the graphs.

Once Standard 4 is done, we can discuss weakness/shortcomings and strength/improvements in our program, then look at other courses - including the ones at an earlier stage of each program - to find *opportunities for improvement* and *close the loop*. That is, we can get to **Standard 6** analysis.

## Summarize Outcomes
Rubric outcome data are collected at individual level. Take average over `Course` level for each assignment. All the inconsistencies have been dealt with.
```{r}
# Undergrad focus for now
tbl1 <- mdf %>% filter(str_detect(Name, "Major|Minor", negate = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(Course, Assessment, Name, PLO) %>%
  summarise(Met = mean(Met.UND.bin), Met.GRD = mean(Met.GRD.bin), n = n())
```

Non-rubric data are collected at `Section` level and as shares of students who achieved goals. Use the class size as a weight to have the proper aggregation. Moreover, keep the `PLO` column for identifying apparently-identical assessments (e.g. different parts of exams).
```{r}
tbl2 <- non %>%
  group_by(Course, Assessment, PLO) %>%
  summarise(Met = weighted.mean(x = np/n, w = n, na.rm = TRUE),
            Met.GRD = Met,
            n = sum(n, na.rm = TRUE), Name = "NA")
```

Now the outcomes are summarized in a compatible way for both rubric-based and non rubric-based assessments.
```{r}
tbl3 <- tbl1 %>% bind_rows(tbl2)
```

## Prepare

Some confusion. I suppose those files in 2019-20 folder are updated versions. However, worksheets contradict with the overview sheet. I don't know what data those sheets refer to.

```

### Discussion

There's some disparity between the instructor comment and outcome. For instance,
```{r}
survey %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3") %>% select(Analysis.Rubric) %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
tbl3 %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3")
```

This is not due to mis-categorized achievement levels.
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3", str_detect(Name, "Hr Law")) %>% group_by(LevelAchieved.Original) %>% summarize(n = n(), Score = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE))
```

It's a small course. Let's look at details...
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3", str_detect(Name, "Hr Law")) %>% group_by(Name) %>% summarize(n = n())
```

4 students did HR Law 1 and HR Law 2, but 8 students did HR Law 3? That doesn't make sense.

Some error with conversion?
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", str_detect(Name, "Hr Law")) %>% group_by(Name) %>% summarize(n = n())
```
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400") %>% group_by(Assessment.Original, Name) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% knitr::kable()
```

That's weird. The numbers of students differ a lot by rubric row, even though there are only three assignments. e.g. Only 3 students are graded for APA/Scholarship for Paper #1, while 14 are graded for Consistency?

As a result, the distribution of grades end up uneven.
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3", str_detect(Name, "Hr Law")) %>% group_by(Name, LevelAchieved.Original) %>% summarize(n = n())
```

- [x] Ask Stephanie about the rubric usage >> Waiting for reply. >> See Follow up below.

A little more check. Frequencies of unique students?
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400") %>% group_by(Section, UserId) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% knitr::kable()
```

For 21 (?) students.

Some alternative names?
```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 1") %>% group_by(Name, UserId) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Name, values_from = n)
```

- `Process/...` rubric row has some duplicates?
- No obvious "substitute" kind


```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 2") %>% group_by(Name, UserId) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Name, values_from = n)
```

Simply missing.

```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3") %>% group_by(Name, UserId) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Name, values_from = n)
```

#### Follow up

```{r}
mdf %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400", Assessment == "Paper 3", str_detect(Name, "Hr Law")) %>% group_by(Name, LevelAchieved.Original) %>% summarize(n = n())
```

Now I have an access to the course HRM 400 001. Checking the rubric `137778`, I don't see any issues. Here's a screenshot of the statistics page for the above rubric row.

![Paper 3 HR Law 3](media/hr400screenshot.png)

Evidently, excellent and Basic are removed in the dataset. Is this an artifact of data munging... somehow? Check the raw data.

```{r}
fn <- "data/Rubrics.xlsx"
df <- read_xlsx(fn) %>%
  mutate(across(c(RubricId:Name, LevelAchieved), factor),
         IsScoreOverridden = (IsScoreOverridden == "True"))
df %>% filter(RubricId == 137778) %>% filter(str_detect(Name, "HR Law 3"))
```

No. Still the same. (Naturally, since I didn't remove any rows...)

This is a small class, I shall collect the data manually. The real concern is that this can be happening to any of the courses. I need to determine the cause.

#### Data Scraping
Now, let's scrape the data. I'll collect all the individual scores, but first I can use D2L statistics for a quick report.

```{r}
survey %>% filter(Course == "HRM 400") %>% select(Analysis.Rubric) %>% knitr::kable()
```

- PLO 1: Paper 1 - Organizational Type. From Unacceptable to Excellent, the distribution is {29, 36, 14, 14, 7} in 5.
- PLO 2: Paper 2 - Organizational Types and Organizational Strategy. The distributions are {23, 23, 15, 15, 23} and {0, 38, 15, 8, 38}
- PLO 3: Paper 3 - HR Law 1-3. The distributions are {14, 7, 7, 7, 64}, {21, 0, 7, 7, 64}, and {36, 0, 14, 21, 29}

Need a caution since I only see percentages and can't tell the sample numbers. That said, it's promising to see all the achievement levels.

```{r}
plo1 <- sum(c(14, 14, 7))/100
plo2 <- sum(c(15, 15, 23, 15, 8, 38))/200
plo3 <- sum(c(7, 7, 64, 7, 7, 64, 14, 21, 29))/300
plo1; plo2; plo3

            n = rep(14, 3)
            )

```

```{r}
x <- x %>% transmute(`Learning Objective Number` = PLO,
                  `Academic Year` = rep(2019, nrow(x)),
                  `Outcome` = Met, `Sample Size` = n )

y <- past %>%
  filter(Program == "Human Resources Management",
         str_detect(`Assessment Type`, "(Internal$)|(Internal Formative)"),
         str_detect(Source, "2020")) %>% 
  select(`Learning Objective Number`, `Academic Year`,
         Outcome, `Sample Size`)
hrm <- bind_rows(x, y)
hrm %>% arrange(`Learning Objective Number`, `Academic Year`)
```

```{r}
ref <- tibble(`Learning Objective Number` = 1:4, goal = rep(0.7, 4))
hrm <- acc %>% left_join(ref, by = "Learning Objective Number")

program <- "Human Resources Management"

title <- paste0(program, ", Prevalence of Achievments Over Academic Years, by PLO")
caption <- "Grey number represents sample size.\nFor 2019, minimum sample size is used if prevalence is computed from multiple criteria."

p <- ggplot(hrm, aes(x = `Academic Year`, y = Outcome,
                        group = `Learning Objective Number`)) +
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Outcome > goal), na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = setNames(c('blue','red'),c(T, F))) +
  geom_text(aes(`Academic Year`, 0.65, label = round(`Sample Size`, 0)),
            alpha = 0.4, na.rm = TRUE) +
