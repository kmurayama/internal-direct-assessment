# README
This is the directory with source data files. Since the data contains sensitive information of students' grades, all the data are kept in the school server (or school affiliated services). Check the notes here to retrieve it and work locally.

- "Rubrics.xlxs" D2L rubric outcomes data have been retrieved and compiled by Jon Kallis. Received on 6/23/2020 and saved in the OneDrive Data folder.
- "Tracking of Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes Data Collection.xlsx" Survey data from MS Forms to collect the information of assessments (either rubric via D2L URL/IDs or non-rubric achievement levels) are stored. The file has been heavily editted to keep track of submissions, but maintained the raw data.
