# README
This is the directory with source data files. Since the data contains sensitive information of students' grades, all the data are kept in the school server (or school affiliated services). Check the notes here to retrieve it and work locally.

- "Rubrics.xlxs" D2L rubric outcomes data have been retrieved and compiled by Jon Kallis. Received on 6/23/2020 and saved in the OneDrive Data folder.
- "Tracking of Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes Data Collection.xlsx" Survey data from MS Forms to collect the information of assessments (either rubric via D2L URL/IDs or non-rubric achievement levels) are stored. The file has been heavily editted to keep track of submissions, but maintained the raw data.
- "Assessment Data Main.xlsx" contains the past assessment summary. Subject to updates.
  - A worksheet "Main" contains the past assessment outcomes reported to ACBSP.
  - A new worksheet "Mapping" is added (7/3/2020), where all the PLOs are summarized and mapped to assessment names (and rubric rows where applicable).
- "Non Rubric Data.xlxs" contains the non-rubric assessments for 2019-20. Collected from the MS Survey (the same one that collected URLs for rubrics.)
- "D2L Rubric Outcomes Request List.csv" is the text file used to rquest rubric outcome data. Data are extracted from the MS Survey for convenience. Note: Apparently they only need `rubricid` in the future.
