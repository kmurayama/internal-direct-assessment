# Objective
Data are mostly cleaned and organized through examining each course. Bring back those procedures into the data munging stage and produce the base statistics for Standard 4.

# Set up

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
source('read.R')
```

```{r}
source('munge.R')
```

```{r}
summary(mdf)
```
